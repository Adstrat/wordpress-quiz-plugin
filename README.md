# wordpress-quiz-plugin

A Custom Block developed as a Plugin to be used in Gutenberg.

The Custom Block uses React to display the block differently on the front and backend.

The frontend can be seen in another github repository [here](https://github.com/Adstrat/Wordpress-Quiz/edit/main/README.md)

Below is a video of how the backend is displayed:

This custom block was developed following tutorials from Brad Shiff on Udemy.
